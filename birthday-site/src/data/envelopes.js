From the very beginning of college until now, you’ve been more than just a best friend to me — you’ve been constant support, comfort, laughter, and home in human form.We’ve been through so many ups and downs together, and somehow you’ve always managed to make things feel lighter, easier, and more possible. You stood by me in moments when I didn’t even know what I needed, and you celebrated with me in ways that made every good moment even better. That kind of loyalty and care is rare, and I never take it for granted.I truly appreciate your patience, your kindness, your honesty, and the way you understand me without me having to explain everything. You’ve seen me at my best and at my worst, and you stayed — and that means more than I can ever fully express.Thank you for being my best friend. Thank you for choosing me again and again, the same way I would always choose you. No matter where life takes us, you will always have a special place in my heart.With so much love and appreciation,Always." },
